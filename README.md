Fruits and Vegetables Image Recognition

**About the Dataset**

**Context**

This dataset encompasses images of various fruits and vegetables, providing a diverse collection for image recognition tasks. The included food items are:

Fruits: Banana, Apple, Pear, Grapes, Orange, Kiwi, Watermelon, Pomegranate, Pineapple, Mango

Vegetables: Cucumber, Carrot, Capsicum, Onion, Potato, Lemon, Tomato, Radish, Beetroot, Cabbage, Lettuce, Spinach, Soybean, Cauliflower, Bell Pepper, Chilli Pepper, Turnip, Corn, Sweetcorn, Sweet Potato, Paprika, JalapeÃ±o, Ginger, Garlic, Peas, Eggplant

Content

The dataset is organized into three main folders:

Train: Contains 100 images per category.
Test: Contains 10 images per category.
Validation: Contains 10 images per category.

Each of these folders is subdivided into specific folders for each type of fruit and vegetable, containing respective images.

**Overview**

This is a machine learning-based image classification project that uses a deep learning model to recognize different fruits and vegetables. The project is built using TensorFlow and Streamlit for an interactive web interface.

ðŸ“Œ Features
ðŸ“· Upload an image of a fruit or vegetable and get real-time predictions.
ðŸ¤– Deep learning-based classification using a trained CNN model (trained_model.h5).
ðŸŽ¨ User-friendly web app powered by Streamlit.
ðŸ“Š Dataset contains images of multiple fruits and vegetables for training, testing, and validation.

ðŸ“Š Model Details
Model trained using TensorFlow Keras CNN.
Input image size: 64x64 pixels.
Uses softmax activation for multi-class classification.
Trained on a dataset of fruits and vegetables.
